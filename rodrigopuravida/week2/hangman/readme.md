A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

Pros:
Functionality is pretty much where I wanted but needed more time.  Not because of lack of but because of being gone.

Issues to work on:
1. 2 player functionality
2. CSS is lacking.  Wanted the game to work and then to make it pretty

Approach:
Designed the one screen game on a piece of paper as a draft and made simple html from that.  After that started coding and adding functionality.
Used 2 APIS to get words as well as similar words for game.

Unsolved problems:
1. Better UI design. Just had no time to look into this.
2. 2 Player mode.  Will work on this very soon.
3. Not hosted yet.
4. Need a way to only display text for number of characters in word.  Probably a very simple oversight.
